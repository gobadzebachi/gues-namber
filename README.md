Guess My Number Game 🎯

This is an interactive web game where your goal is to guess a random number between 1 and 20. At the start of the game, a secret number is generated, and you have to enter your guess and click the Check button.

After each attempt, you will receive a hint:

If your guess is higher than the secret number, you’ll know to lower your guess.

If it’s lower, you’ll know to increase it.

The game tracks your score, which decreases with each wrong guess, and it also saves your high score so you can try to beat it.

Features:

🎲 Random number generation

📉 Score tracking and reduction on wrong guesses

🏆 High score saving

🔄 Restart the game with the Again! button
